(A TrueType font )


So speaks Leon del Muerte:


This is my first publicly released typeface, and I'm hoping that what I'm writing now isn't a total waste of time. Incantation is a spikey, splintered headline font that was evolved from two things:


the kind of 'scratched-in-with-a-pencil' look that some underground bands used, that I admire, and 
from the band, INCANTATION, whose logo is somewhat like this, but not really. Very loosely based on this, I guess I should say. 

If you would like to see any changes in it, I would be more than happy (trust me, I have really nothing better to do) to change it, and I am totally open to suggestions.

For now, INCANTATION is an all-caps typeface, but in the next release, I plan to have some more umlauts, diala-whatchamacall'em things and all that stuff, and a lower case set. If you are interested in other Death metal/grindcore type fonts I've made, but haven't released, mail me.

This typeface is CANNIBALWARE; send no money, but you must eat the very next person you see, or send a postcard. Also, if you're into death metal, buy my band, Infanticide's demo!! Inquire at any of those addresses.
